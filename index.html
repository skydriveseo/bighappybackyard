					<p>A tree home is an excellent way of connecting your kids to nature. There's no doubt that they all love spending private time and having fun without the need for constant disturbance from their parents.</p>
					<p>Therefore, a private tree home is eco-friendly and great to get some outdoor activities into your routine.</p>
					<p>However, one question comes to mind. Is it worth all the effort to create a treehouse on your own, or should you just buy one? Well, worry no more! This post will help you out.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Here we are going to compare the methods as well as the pros and cons of creating a tree home vs. buying one, so you can decide for yourself which suits your needs the best.</p>
					<p>Creating a Tree Home</p>
					<p>Building your own tree home from scratch takes a lot of effort. However, with just a few tips and tricks and 5 simple steps, you'll get a home where your kid would spend their entire summer.</p>
					<h2><strong>Step 1: Pick</strong><strong>ing</strong><strong> the right tree</strong></h2>
					<p>Choosing a tree is one of the most critical steps for the safety of your kids. And you can do it by just keeping a few measurements in mind.&nbsp;</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li>An average treehouse is about 8 feet by foot, so consider a tree with a trunk of about 1 foot.</li>
					<li>Suppose your tree has more than one trunk, you can go shorter on the trunk size.</li>
					<li>Your treehouse should be built at least 2.5 - 3 meters above the ground.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Make sure your chosen tree is solid and firm enough to hold a tree home. Moreover, it should be steady enough to stand a lousy weather forecast.</p>
					<h2><strong>Step 2: </strong><strong>Choosing</strong><strong> your design</strong></h2>
					<p>Before starting the construction, it is essential to choose your design. There are hundreds of designs available on different platforms with tutorials. You can compare and choose according to your available tree and your carpentering skills.</p>
					<h2><strong>Step 3: Gather</strong><strong>ing</strong><strong> your tools and material</strong></h2>
					<p>For this job, it is necessary that you already have all the needed material beforehand, so you don't have to run to get something in the middle of your construction. The primary material and tools that you would need are:</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li>Nails</li>
					<li>Screws&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Lumbers</li>
					<li>Decking material</li>
					<li>Galvanized lag screws and washers</li>
					<li>Galvanized joist hangers</li>
					<li>Galvanized raft ties</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These are the material that you would need to make a simple treehouse. However, to assemble all this, you'll need different tools, which may include:</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li>Hammer</li>
					<li>Jigsaw</li>
					<li>Tape measure</li>
					<li>Adjustable wrench</li>
					<li>Router</li>
					<li>Level</li>
					<li>Miter and table saw</li>
					</ul>
					<h2><strong>Step 4: Build</strong><strong>ing</strong><strong> the primary support</strong></h2>
					<p>Constructing the leading platform of a treehouse is an essential part of this process. You have to get it right; if not, all of your hard work could go in vain in a matter of time and be a safety hazard for your little ones. So, invest your time and do your best to get this step right.</p>
					<p>You can ensure that the leading platform is well adjusted and placed on the tree by attaching it to the support and putting braces below it. This makes a significant difference in the steadiness of the treehouse.</p>
					<h2><strong>Step 5: Construct</strong><strong>ing</strong><strong> the body of the treehouse</strong></h2>
					<p>When the floor's framing is done, lay it down and attach the deckers to it. If this seems like an extra step, you can also replace it by adding large timber sheets as flooring.&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Now, as the challenging part is undoubtedly over, it's time to put on the railings and walls. This step is up to your creativity; however you like, you can do it. You can add fencing and windows and make a grand entrance door at the end but don't forget a ladder so that your kids can go into the treehouse.</p>
					<p>At this point, you can create your ladder as well. In fact, it&rsquo;s the ideal time to do so.</p>
					<p>These were the five simple steps to create your own tree home, but is it worth the trouble? Here are a few pros and cons so you can decide for yourself.</p>
					<h3><strong>Pros</strong></h3>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li>Spending quality time with your kids by including them in the project.</li>
					<li>The sense of accomplishment you can achieve after creating the tree home yourself.</li>
					<li>You can make fun memories while working on your ideal tree home.</li>
					<li>Your kids would get a chance to learn a skill and brag about it to their friends.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3><strong>Cons</strong></h3>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li>You will need skills and dedication</li>
					<li>While building it, if you won't take proper precautions, it can be a safety hazard to you and your kids.</li>
					<li>If you would not spend the proper time and effort to build it, all of this could go to waste within a few months.</li>
					<li>Your skill set might limit the creativity you can put into making a treehouse.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Buying a Tree Home</p>
					<p>Buying a treehouse is a much simpler process than building one on your own. It's quite an easy process, and with a few crucial decisions to take, you can also get a treehouse built in your backyard. Those decisions might include:</p>
					<ul class="bulletic">
					<li>Choosing a well-established tree house building company that you can trust in building your kid's second home.</li>
					<li>Choosing a design that suits your needs and your interior design style as well.</li>
					</ul>
